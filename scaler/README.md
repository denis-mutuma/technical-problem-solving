# Prefix Matching

Problem Description

We have a list of lexicographically sorted strings A. We also have a string B. We need the first and last indexes of strings from A which are having their prefix as B. A can contain duplicate strings.

Return [-1, -1] if no such prefix exists.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 105

1 <= âˆ‘|A[i]| <= 106

1 <= |B| <= 105



Input Format

The first line contains an array of strings A.

The second line contains the required prefix B.



Output Format

Return a vector containing first and last indexes and [-1, -1] in case no such prefix exists. Consider 0-based indexing.



Example Input

Input 1:

  A = [a, aa, aab, b, bb, bba, bbb]
 B = bb
Input 2:

 A = [a, b]
 B = c


Example Output

Output 1:

 [4, 6]
Output 2:

 [-1, -1]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 bb occurs as prefix in bb,bba and bb.
Explanation 2:

 c is not present as prefix.
